# Triston Thompson's OSINT Learning Blog

---

In August 2010, 33 miners were stuck 700 meters underground because of a collapse at the San Jos√© mine. OSINT played a significant role in helping them be rescued. Factors like journalists, photos, and satellite imagery helped identify which access points were usable and what structures were compromised. OSINT made the rescue faster and helped make better-informed decisions, reducing delays and risk. After 69 days, the rescue capsule brought all 33 miners to the surface alive. That drew me to OSINT; good information can save lives. I'm interested in OSINT because having the correct information or missing it is the line between success and disaster in high-stakes situations.

OSINT stands for open-source intelligence, which is defined as the process of collecting and analyzing public information to use that intelligence for a specific purpose. My name is Triston Thompson, and I am a cybersecurity major at Penn State. Through this blog, I plan to document my process of learning OSINT publicly to help other beginners because it can be hard to find a starting point.

I've always been drawn to the idea of being an investigator. I've looked up to people who work in private sectors, three-letter agencies, and police departments. I was also what you would call an 'iPad kid' before I grew out of it, so I was exposed to the internet at a very young age. This allowed me to see what the internet is like, both its good and bad sides. Learning more about OSINT matters because I plan on working in one of those three-letter agencies or the private sector. Throughout high school, I've gotten familiar with metadata, Kali Linux, and Google dorking. However, I still consider myself a beginner in all these fields.

I started a blog because I have always enjoyed writing about my interests. This is the perfect way to have a public record of what I did and what path I followed to learn everything I need to know. This way, I can build a portfolio while helping other beginners know where to start in their OSINT Journey. Knowing where to begin learning OSINT can be hard, so I hope my path helps others do the same. Most people in cybersecurity end up graduating with all these different cybersecurity certificates. I still have no OSINT certificates or experience, so since I plan on working in this area, I'm taking the initiative with this blog.

In this blog, I will write about:
* OSINT investigations and case studies that I do
* The tools and techniques that I'm learning
* Legal and ethical boundaries
* My mistakes and lessons learned
* How other concepts (cybersecurity, social engineering) connect to OSINT

I will post about what I'm doing and my goals on this blog about two to three times a month. I'm a beginner, so that's the level of stuff I'll be doing. I will be honest and practical in my write-ups; I am not claiming expertise. This blog will be for a beginner going through the process of learning OSINT. However, it will still benefit people in the same shoes as me who are learning different OSINT techniques.

I hope this blog benefits some people and that my learning experience helps others make theirs smoother and simpler. My next blog post will be a Geolocation challenge, in which I'll try to find where a photo online was taken using only public tools. Then I'll document every step of the way.
